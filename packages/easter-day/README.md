Calculates the local date of the Easter day for years up to 9999.

## Install

For NodeJS and JS bundlers:

```bash
npm i @jsbits/easter-day
# or
yarn add @jsbits/easter-day
```

or load `easterDay` in the browser:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@jsbits/easter-day/index.b.min.js"></script>
```

### Targets

- ES5 compatible browser
- NodeJS v4.2 or later

## `easterDay(year)` â‡’ `Date` 

Calculates the local date of the Easter day â€“aka _Pascha_ or
_Resurrection Sunday_â€“ for years between 100 and 9999 in the
Gregorian calendar, based on Oudin's algorithm.

Easter always falls on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25, inclusive.

**NOTE:** The result for years less than 1583 _could be inaccurate_.

This is a good algorithm, but calculating the Easter is not an exact
science or something consensuated, so expect discrepancies with older
or future implementations.

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| year | `number` | Year for the desired date, between 100 and 9999 |

**Returns**: `Date` - Local date instance for the Easter day  

Since 1.1.3<br>
