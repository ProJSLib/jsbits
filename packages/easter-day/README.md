Part of the [JSBits][jsbits-url] suite.

Calculates the local date of the Easter day for years up to 9999

## Install

```bash
npm i @jsbits/easter-day
# or
yarn add @jsbits/easter-day
```

### Targets

- ES5 compatible browser
- NodeJS v4.2 or later

## `easterDay(year)` â‡’ `Date` 

Calculates the local date for the Easter day, aka _Pascha_ or
_Resurrection Sunday_, based on Oudin's algorithm for years between 100
and 9999 in the Gregorian calendar.

Easter always falls on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25, inclusive.

This is a good algorithm, but calculating the Easter is not an exact
science or something concensed, so expect discrepancies with other
implementations.

_**Note:**_

_The result for years less than 1583 could be inaccurate._

| Param | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| year | `number` | Year for the desired date, between 100 and 9999 |

**Returns**: `Date` - Local date instance for the Easter day  

Since 1.1.3<br>
Group: date<br>
Author/Maintainer: aMarCruz<br>
