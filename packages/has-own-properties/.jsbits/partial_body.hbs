### Object.prototype.hasOwnProperties

If you prefer, you can inject this function into the `Object.prototype` by requiring 'proto' or by loading the IIFE from 'has-own-properties/proto.js' in your browser:

```ts
require('@jsbits/has-own-properties/proto')

const anObject = { foo: 'bar' }
const hasProps = anObject.hasOwnProperties()
```
