## WARNING

v1.1.0 has **_breaking changes_**.

- Now, `addMonths` only works with values type Date and number, with other types it returns an invalid date.
- The API of the `Date.prototype.addMonth` method has been changed to make it more consistent with the other methods of the `Date` object.

For this time, due to the fact that v1.0.0 did not have enough diffusion, the major version remained unchanged.

By the way: Avoid creating dates with strings, it is inconsistent.

From [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) at MDN:

> Note: parsing of date strings with the `Date` constructor (and `Date.parse`, they are equivalent) is strongly discouraged due to browser differences and inconsistencies. Support for [RFC 2822](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14) format strings is by convention only. Support for [ISO 8601](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15) formats differs in that date-only strings (e.g. "1970-01-01") are treated as UTC, not local.

Even node 6 has issues with this. _Do not use it_ except with the full UTC ISO-8601 format (ending with 'Z').

\* See the helper on the [example](#example) for a workaround.
