Part of the [JSBits][jsbits-url] suite.

Adds or sustract X months to any JavaScript Date, local or UTC.

## WARNING

v1.1.0 has **_breaking changes_**.

- Now, `addMonths` only works with values type Date and number, with other types it returns an invalid date.
- The API of the `Date.prototype.addMonth` method has been changed to make it more consistent with the other methods of the `Date` object.

For this time, due to the fact that v1.0.0 did not have enough diffusion, the major version remained unchanged.

By the way: Avoid creating dates with strings, it is inconsistent.

From [Date](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date) at MDN:

> Note: parsing of date strings with the `Date` constructor (and `Date.parse`, they are equivalent) is strongly discouraged due to browser differences and inconsistencies. Support for [RFC 2822](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#page-14) format strings is by convention only. Support for [ISO 8601](http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-15.9.1.15) formats differs in that date-only strings (e.g. "1970-01-01") are treated as UTC, not local.

Even node 6 has issues with this. _Do not use it_ except with the full UTC ISO-8601 format (ending with 'Z').

\* See the helper on the [example](#example) for a workaround.

## Install

```bash
npm i @jsbits/add-months
# or
yarn add @jsbits/add-months
```

### Targets

- ES5 compatible browser
- NodeJS v4.2 or later

## `addMonths(startdate, count, [asUTC])` â‡’ `Date` 

Returns a date occurring `count` months after `startdate` or, if `count` is
negative, the date occurring `count` months before `startdate`.

- If startdate is not a Date, string, or number that can be converted to a
   valid date, returns a new Date instance with an invalid date.

- If count is evaluated as zero, returns a new Date instance with the
   the same value as startdate.

- If there is an overflow in the day, the date is adjusted to the last
   valid day of the expected month.

The third parameter is optional and indicates if the date is UTC. It is
necessary to differentiate UTC dates from locals to avoid errors due to the
[Daylight Saving Time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time)
(DST).

This function does not change the original date.

| Param | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| startdate | `Date` \| `number` |  | A value parseable as a JavaScript Date |
| count | `number` |  | Number of months to add or substract |
| \[asUTC] | `boolean` | `false` | If `true`, handle the date as UTC |

**Returns**: `Date` - A new, adjusted Date instance.

### Example

```ts
import addMonths from '@jsbits/add-months'

// Helper for creating a local date based on a string
const toDate = (ds) => {
  const dt = ds.split(/[-T: ]/)
  return new Date(dt[0], dt[1] - 1, dt[2], ~~dt[3], ~~dt[4], ~~dt[5])
}

// can increment above one year
addMonths(toDate('2017-01-08'), 15)  // â‡’ 2018-04-08 06:00:00

// decrement works
addMonths(toDate('2017-01-01'), -1)  // â‡’ 2016-12-01 06:00:00

// avoids day overflow
addMonths(toDate('2017-01-31'), 1)  // â‡’ 2017-02-28 06:00:00

// can handle leap years
addMonths(toDate('2016-01-31'), 1)  // â‡’ 2016-02-29 06:00:00

// with the third parameter, date is handled as UTC
addMonths(new Date('2015-01-01T05:00:00Z'), 1, true)  // â‡’ 2015-02-01 05:00:00Z

// it accepts numericals parameters
addMonths(1541898143424, 1)  // â‡’ 2018-12-11 01:02:23

// returns an Invalid Date (i.e. NaN) for other types,
// to avoid undesired conversions to the current date.
addMonths(false, 1)  // â‡’ NaN
```

### Date.prototype.addMonths

If you prefer, you can inject this function into the `Date.prototype` by requiring 'proto' or by loading the IIFE from 'add-months/proto.js' in your browser.

In Date.prototype the function is exposed in separate methods: `addMonths` for local dates, and `addUTCMonths` for UTC dates, so the `asUTC` flag is not required.

Also, its behavior changes to that of a setter. That is, the value of the date on which these methods operate _is changed_.

Although you can use `Date.prototype.addMonth.call()`, its use with a type different than Date generates a TypeError.

The return value of both methods is the number of milliseconds between 1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC and the updated date, or `NaN` if the date is invalid.

This example shows the behavior of both methods using the same date instance:

```ts
// this is using ESM syntax, but you can use require()
import '@jsbits/add-months/proto'

// helpers
const showLoc = (dt) => console.log('' + dt)
const showUTC = (dt) => console.log(dt.toJSON())
const showRes = (dt) => console.log(dt)

const date = new Date(2018, 0, 30, 20, 0, 0)

showLoc(date)                   // â‡’ Tue Jan 30 2018 20:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST)
showRes(date.addMonths(1))      // â‡’ 1519869600000
showLoc(date)                   // â‡’ Wed Feb 28 2018 20:00:00 GMT-0600 (CST)

showUTC(date)                   // â‡’ 2018-03-01T02:00:00.000Z
showRes(date.addUTCMonths(1))   // â‡’ 1522548000000
showUTC(date)                   // â‡’ 2018-04-01T02:00:00.000Z
```

### Note about DST

For local dates, the time offset may change if the resulting date has DST activation different from the original.

For example, if a GMT-0600 zone changes to GMT-0500 between May and October, the following will shift the time offset preserving the hour:

```ts
const origin = new Date('2018-01-20T16:00:00')  // â‡’ 2018-01-20 16:00 GMT-0600
const result = addMonths(origin, 6)             // â‡’ 2018-07-20 16:00 GMT-0500
```

However, the UTC time which has no offset does change:

```ts
console.log(origin.toISOString())   // â‡’ 2018-01-20T22:00:00.000Z
console.log(result.toISOString())   // â‡’ 2018-07-20T21:00:00.000Z
```

The same happens if you apply a `setMonth(6)` to that date, which is correct and generally expected, but keep it in mind if you handle UTC dates based on local dates.

## Imports
